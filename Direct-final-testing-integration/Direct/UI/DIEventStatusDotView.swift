/* DIEventStatusDotView.swift

 * This file is used to define the view of the label written under an event which
 * gives the user information about the time of the event relative to the current
 * event. For example, it might tell you the event was 1 day ago, or happening
 * now. It will display this relative time string with a colorful dot which expresses
 * the state of the event (ended, happening now, or upcoming).
