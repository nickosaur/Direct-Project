# Direct
## Introduction
Direct is an iOS application that offers real-time browsing of events that are currently happening near you. Users can post their own events, browse a feed of events, and view live videos and photos from users currently attending an event. Additionally, users can view a list of upcoming events around them. Direct is a mobile platform for advertising live or upcoming event information more effectively, compared to what is traditionally accomplished using flyers.
